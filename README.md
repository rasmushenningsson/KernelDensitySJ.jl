Bandwidth selection using Sheather and Jones algorithm also known as width.SJ or bw.SJ. (The specific version of the algorithm is sometimes referred to as "solve-the-equation".)
Only Gaussian kernels are supported.

The aim of this package is to provide implementation of the Sheather and Jones algorithm for bandwidth selection that is:
* Accurate
* Reasonably fast


## Installation
Start the Julia REPL, press ']' to enter package mode and type
```
add https://github.com/rasmushenningsson/KernelDensitySJ.jl.git
```

## Usage Example
```julia
using KernelDensitySJ
X = randn(1000);
bwsj(X)
```

## Technical Details
The bandwidth is computed by solving equation (12) in [Sheather and Jones, 1991] using root-finding methods.
To solve the equation both accurately and fast, this packages computes and successively refines lower and upper bounds of the target function for a given bandwidth until the bounds no longer includes 0, which is enough to bracket the root.
